## Instructions
	1. Install required Python packages (for 3.6). You can find them in the Pipfile under the [packages] heading, or you can install all from the Pipfile if your package manager supports it
	2. Change directory to the `src/` folder and run the `main.py` script. Then visit `localhost:5000` (or whatever is displayed in the console, if that's different) to see the webpage.

	I don't believe detect changes is enabled, so you'll have to restart the server each time you make an edit. I've also gotten some strange bugs that might be related to caching, so clear that if some things are out of date.
